Runquan is a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Psychology at the University of Macau. He has worked "Affective, Neuroscience, and Decision-making Lab" (AND LAB) led by Haiyan WU from August 2021, in Centre for Cognitive and Brain Sciences and Department of Psychology at the University of Macau. 

He expects to focus on human behavioural and neural responses in social scenarios. In particular, he is interested in the behavioural and neural mechanisms of human social interaction, especially in humans with anxiety, depression, and loneliness with several personalities. His goal is to be a researcher to help children and young adults struggling with mental health, especially those in vulnerable communities. 

Currently, (1) he is working on social navigation domains and fMRI scanning, (2) dealing with EEG data with ageing Chinese people (microstate) for discussing cognition deficiency, (3) and investigating psychometric quantitative data analysis about anxious individuals' interaction.
